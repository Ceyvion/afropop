# Stabilization & Modernization Work Log

## Plan
- [x] Fix broken navigation routes and remove dead header/footer links
- [x] Implement mobile navigation menu and wire header search button to `/search`
- [x] Replace dead social/newsletter controls with real destinations
- [x] Fix broken home media embed and add app icon assets
- [x] Make search results navigable with canonical hrefs
- [x] Add pagination to `/api/search` and search UI
- [x] Add `quality` + pagination support to `/api/calendar-events`
- [x] Improve event curation quality in calendar ingestion
- [x] Add shared async-state UI primitive and apply to core surfaces
- [x] Add baseline legal/contact pages to remove footer 404s
- [x] Stabilize lint in CI with non-interactive ESLint config
- [x] Add/extend tests for pagination and degraded API behaviors

## Verification Checklist
- [x] `npm run test -- --runInBand`
- [x] `npm run build`
- [x] `npm run lint`
- [x] Manual route sanity check (dev server routes return 200 for core nav/footer targets)

## Review
- Implemented P0/P1 stabilization work and shipped the critical trust fixes.
- Added API pagination + curated event quality filtering and updated UI consumers.
- Added explicit degraded editorial API status (`503` + service code) and regression tests.
- Remaining warnings are non-blocking (image optimization and hook dependency lint warnings).
- `next start` in this environment still reports module resolution issues tied to mixed lockfile detection (`pnpm-lock.yaml` at `/Users/macbookpro` vs local `package-lock.json`), while `next dev`, tests, lint, and build pass.

## Security Hotfix (Next.js CVE Gate)
### Plan
- [x] Upgrade `next` and `eslint-config-next` to a patched 15.x release accepted by Vercel security checks.
- [x] Regenerate lockfile and ensure no vulnerable `next` version remains.
- [x] Re-run `npm run lint`, `npm run test -- --runInBand`, and `npm run build`.
- [x] Commit and push hotfix to `origin/main`.

### Review
- [x] Upgraded from `15.4.6` to `15.5.12` for both `next` and `eslint-config-next`.
- [x] `npm audit` no longer reports a `next` package vulnerability.
- [x] Validation completed successfully: lint (warnings only), tests (5/5), build (success).

## Store Artwork Fill (No Empty Tiles)
### Plan
- [x] Generate artwork assets for each product tile plus featured collection hero art.
- [x] Wire generated assets into `/shop` product data and card rendering.
- [x] Ensure image rendering has accessible alt text and no visual empty states remain.
- [x] Run lint + build verification and document outcomes.

### Review
- [x] Generated seven new store artworks and published optimized `.webp` files under `/public/images/store`.
- [x] Replaced dashed placeholders in `/shop` cards and featured panel with `next/image` media blocks.
- [x] Added descriptive alt text for each store product tile and featured collection image.
- [x] Verification passed: `npm run lint` (warnings only) and `npm run build` (success).

# RSS Speed Optimization Work Log

## Plan
- [x] Profile current RSS hot paths and identify avoidable repeated work
- [x] Precompute RSS item search/date metadata during normalization
- [x] Cache per-type sorted RSS slices at feed resolution time
- [x] Refactor RSS filtering/sorting to reuse precomputed metadata
- [x] Add/adjust API response cache headers for faster repeated RSS reads
- [x] Verify with tests and production build

## Verification Checklist
- [x] `npm run test -- --runInBand`
- [x] `npm run build`

## Review
- Reworked RSS hot paths to eliminate repeated date parsing/string normalization on each request.
- Added feed-level indexes (`byType`, `byId`, pre-sorted items) and metadata-backed filtering for faster search/type lookups.
- Switched source loading from sequential fallback to parallel `Promise.any` resolution to reduce slow-source tail latency.
- Added response cache headers on RSS-backed API routes (`/api/rss`, `/api/search`, `/api/episodes`, `/api/features`, `/api/item/[...id]`).
- Verification passed: `npm run test -- --runInBand`, `npm run build`.
- Benchmark (500-item feed, warm cache):
- Old vs new `searchRSSFeed` x100: `179.31ms` -> `76.99ms` (~`2.33x` faster)
- Old vs new `getRSSItemsByType` x100: `22.68ms` -> `0.21ms` (~`108x` faster)

# Redesign Bugfix Work Log

## Plan
- [x] Audit redesigned files and enumerate concrete regressions with file references
- [x] Fix Tailwind accent opacity regression (`accent-v/*` classes not generated)
- [x] Validate line clamp styles for redesigned cards/content blocks (utilities already generated by current Tailwind)
- [x] Fix invalid `h-18` class causing collapsed news thumbnails
- [x] Re-run verification (`npm run lint`, `npm run test -- --runInBand`, `npm run build`)

## Verification Checklist
- [x] `npm run lint`
- [x] `npm run test -- --runInBand`
- [x] `npm run build`

## Review
- Added Tailwind `accent-v` color mapped to `--accent-rgb` so opacity classes like `text-accent-v/70`, `bg-accent-v/10`, and `border-accent-v/30` now compile and render.
- Added seasonal `--accent-rgb` tokens in `globals.css` to keep accent opacity behavior consistent across spring/summer/autumn/winter themes.
- Replaced invalid `h-18` with `h-20` for home news thumbnails so media containers no longer collapse.
- Verified that `line-clamp-*` utilities already compile in current Tailwind output; no plugin patch required.
- Verification passed: `npm run lint`, `npm run test -- --runInBand`, `npm run build`.

# Events Dedupe + City Filter Bugfix

## Plan
- [x] Reproduce bug symptoms from screenshot and trace `/events` data flow.
- [x] Improve calendar near-duplicate collapse for same-time/same-city title variants.
- [x] Normalize city labels in UI filter chips to remove duplicates/placeholders.
- [x] Add regression tests for dedupe behavior.
- [x] Verify with lint, tests, and production build.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] `npm run lint`
- [x] `npm run test -- --runInBand`
- [x] `npm run build`

## Review
- Added fuzzy near-duplicate collapse in `/app/lib/google-calendar-service.js` using city canonicalization + title token similarity + start-time proximity.
- Added city canonicalization in `/app/events/page.tsx` so city chips no longer split into redundant values like `New York`, `New York City`, and `New York, NY`, and placeholder values (`Location TBA`) are excluded from suggestions.
- Added regression tests in `/app/lib/google-calendar-service.test.js` covering both duplicate collapse and preserving valid multi-session events.
