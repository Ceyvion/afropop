# NEXT STEPS: Implementing Third-Party RSS Service for Afropop Worldwide

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Select Third-Party RSS Service
Choose one of the following recommended services:

#### Option A: RSS.app (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Easy setup, reliable parsing, good documentation, affordable pricing
- **Pricing**: Free tier (100 requests/day), Paid plans ($19-99/month)
- **Setup Time**: ~15 minutes
- **Website**: https://rss.app

#### Option B: Feedly Cloud API
- **Pros**: Enterprise-grade, extensive features, real-time updates
- **Cons**: Higher cost, more complex setup
- **Pricing**: Paid plans only ($50-500+/month)
- **Website**: https://feedly.com

#### Option C: Superfeedr
- **Pros**: Real-time updates, webhook support, developer-friendly
- **Cons**: Legacy service, limited documentation
- **Pricing**: Various plans available
- **Website**: https://superfeedr.com

### 2. Create Account and Obtain API Key
1. Sign up for chosen service
2. Navigate to developer/API section
3. Generate new API key
4. Note rate limits and usage quotas

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# Third-party RSS service configuration
RSS_PARSER_SERVICE=rssapp  # or 'feedly' or 'superfeedr'
RSS_PARSER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
AFROPOP_RSS_URL=https://afropop.org/feed/podcast
RSS_CACHE_TIMEOUT=300000  # 5 minutes in milliseconds

# Optional: Multiple service configuration for redundancy
RSS_PARSER_SERVICE_BACKUP=
RSS_PARSER_API_KEY_BACKUP=
```

### 4. Update RSS Service Configuration
In `app/lib/rss-service-enhanced.ts`, ensure the configuration matches your environment:

```typescript
// Configuration for RSS parsing service
const RSS_PARSER_SERVICE = process.env.RSS_PARSER_SERVICE || 'direct' // 'rssapp', 'feedly', 'superfeedr', or 'direct'
const RSS_PARSER_API_KEY = process.env.RSS_PARSER_API_KEY || ''
const AFROPOP_RSS_URL = process.env.AFROPOP_RSS_URL || 'https://afropop.org/feed/podcast'
const CACHE_TIMEOUT = parseInt(process.env.RSS_CACHE_TIMEOUT || '300000') // 5 minutes default
```

## Testing with Real RSS Feed

### 1. Local Development Testing
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:3000/api/rss in browser
3. Verify successful response with RSS feed data
4. Check console for any errors

### 2. Test Search Functionality
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=test
2. Verify search returns filtered results
3. Test filtering with query parameters:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/search?type=Episode`
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/search?region=Africa`
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/search?genre=Highlife`

### 3. Test Individual Endpoints
1. Get episodes: http://localhost:3000/api/episodes
2. Get features: http://localhost:3000/api/features
3. Get specific item: http://localhost:3000/api/item/[valid_item_id]

## Deployment Preparation

### 1. Staging Environment Setup
1. Configure environment variables on staging server
2. Deploy to staging environment
3. Conduct thorough testing with real data
4. Verify performance and error handling

### 2. Production Environment Setup
1. Add production API keys to environment
2. Configure monitoring and alerting
3. Set up automated backups
4. Implement rollback procedures

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Set Up Monitoring
1. Configure application performance monitoring (APM)
2. Set up error tracking and alerting
3. Implement usage analytics
4. Configure third-party service health checks

### 2. Key Metrics to Monitor
- Response time < 500ms for 95th percentile
- Uptime > 99.9%
- Error rate < 0.1%
- Cache hit ratio > 80%
- Third-party service availability

## Security Considerations

### 1. Credential Management
- Store API keys in secure environment variables
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Implement key vault for enterprise deployments

### 2. Input Validation
- Validate all API inputs
- Sanitize content to prevent XSS
- Implement rate limiting
- Set up DDoS protection

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. API Key Errors
- Verify API key is correct and active
- Check service dashboard for key status
- Ensure key has proper permissions
- Confirm key hasn't exceeded usage limits

### 2. CORS Issues
- RSS proxy should handle CORS automatically
- Verify proxy is correctly configured
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Test direct feed access in browser

### 3. Parsing Failures
- Check RSS feed validity in browser
- Verify feed conforms to RSS/Atom standards
- Test with different RSS parsing services
- Implement graceful degradation to direct parsing

### 4. Performance Issues
- Check cache hit ratio
- Verify third-party service response times
- Optimize database queries if applicable
- Implement request batching for multiple items
